                    I am computer science major. I am currently a junior at George Washington Universty. I was born and raised in Punjab, India. But I went to boarding school in the United States. I joined this program to learn some much needed skills for the real world if software engineering. I am looking forward to make connections as well as long life long friends through this program. Happy New Year Everyone!<br>
                    I enjoy exploring new places around the city and boxing outside of the classroom. I am also used to be a dancer competitively while I was young. But, I have definitely lost some my moves along the way! :p
